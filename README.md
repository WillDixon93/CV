## Will Dixon

A bar manager, a policy executive and a student of Makers. The start to both a terrible 'walk into a bar' joke I haven't written the punchline of yet, and my career to date. I have spent my post education career supplying budget submissions and recommendations from industry to the Government, writing toolkits to instruct businesses on how they can help alleviate the problem of homelessness and fixing all the IT for everyone else in the office. Through all that I have found that nothing excites me more than solving a problem in code.

## Experience

**Revo** (2019 - 2020)  
Policy and Campaigns Executive

A first foray into the world of work that had very little to do with programming. The role included campaign management, submissions to parliament and correspondence with Members of Parliament. Previous campaigns that I was involved in included a "dragons den" style competition for start-up and small businesses to award space in a number of shopping centres throughout the UK, and Revo's homelessness campaign that I lead on. This involved submissions and recommendations to Parliament, the writing of functional toolkits for land and shopping centre owners to use in order to proactively and compassionately help reduce homelessness in the UK. 

## Skills

#### Campaign management

Working as a campaign executive in a very small team (3) meant I had to take ownership of campaigns quickly after conception. Due to the size of the team and our ambition we had numerous projects going on at the same time, which involved heavy-lifting from everyone. This has given me the ability to work on a number of projects at any one time, as well as becoming skilled quickly in a specific topic with previous knowledge. Given my previous job and education, this particular skill will hold me in good stead for this new adventure.

#### Teamwork

Working in policy and campaigns is inherently an interaction based role. Asking for help from experts, penning responses to legislation, and even trying to pretend I belong at all the UK's political party conferences have meant I've developed the ability to work in a team, provide both real and metaphorical heavy-lifting when needed, and most of all get on well with everyone in my team.

## Hobbies

- Sports, video games and guitar are my three biggest passions. 
- In the world of sport I can often be found deep in the jungle hacking my way round any number of golf courses, playing 5-a-side football for five minutes before realising I'm not 15 anymore and have two dodgy shoulders. 
- In the world of guitar, a perennial amateur - grades were less important than nailing the first 45 seconds of Sweet Child O' Mine. Sadly I only play acoustic now so that particular party trick is no longer useful. 
- In the world of video games, you'll not find many happier to find a random simulator game to waste an hour on before deciding Red Dead II is a far better use of my time.
